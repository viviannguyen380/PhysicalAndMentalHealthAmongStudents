  <p>Sleep schedules can get worse overtime as students get distracted by their electronic devices throughout the day.
    In effect, this causes students to work on their homework late at night and their sleeping time to become shorter.
    Students should try to sleep from 11pm - 7am to recieve around 8 hours of sleep. The benefit of this is feeling more
    rested and focused.</p>

<p>It is much better to be able to focus than to cram an extra worksheet at night and losing 2 hours of precious rest time!</p>
  <p>Try creating a work schedule that allows you time to finish your work, exercise, have free time, and spend time with your family. This will allow you to take full advantage of your days, increasing your productivity and improving your focus! </p>
