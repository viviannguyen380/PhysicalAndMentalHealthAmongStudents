  <p>Many students come home from a long day of school to loads of homework and tests to study for. Combined with
    mealtime and other responsibilities, it can be difficult to find time to work out. </p>
  <p>While you're doing your homework, try getting up and stretching or walking around your house for a minute or 2.
    This will allow you to stretch out unused muscles and prevent back pain. Furthermore, changing your work enviornment
    can improve your brain function and allow you to focus better upon returning to your work!</p>
  <p>Here are some yoga poses you can try!</p>
  <h3>Tree Pose:</h3>

    alt="Tree Pose" width="400" height="400">
  <p>Step 1. Bend one leg and keep the other on the floor.
  <p> Step 2. Place the foot of your bent leg on your standing leg's lower inner thigh. </p>
  <p> Step 3. Clasp your hands together in Anjali Mudra (also called the “prayer position”) and raise your arms above
    your head. In this form, your head, shoulders, pelvis, and left foot should align vertically (MasterClass). Hold for
    30 seconds and repeat with the opposite leg. </p>
  <p>This pose stretches your feet, improves your balance, and can strengthen your core! Balancing your total body
    weight on one foot engages your lower and middle body. But remember to keep your back straight and avoid pressing
    your foot right into your knee!</p>
  <h3>Cobra Pose:</h3>

    alt="Cobra Pose" width="640" height="400">
  <p>Step 1: On a flat, soft surface (like a yoga mat), lie down on your belly. Keep your feet hip-distance apart on the
    floor and place your hands behind your ribs. </p>
  <p>Step 2: Pressing down lightly with your hands, start to lift your head and chest, rolling your shoulders back and
    down.</p>
  <p>Step 3:Keeping your neck long and straight, Straighten your arms while keeping your shoulders remaining away from
    your ears. Keep at least a slight bend in your elbows.</p>
  <p>Step 4: Hold for 20-30 seconds, then release back to the mat to end the pose.</p>
  <p>The Cobra pose is ideal for those who do computer work and seated for long periods of time. Doing this exercise
    stretches the back and improves your posture. This can also build confidence as you stretch high for your dreams!
    Remember to only stretch as far as you're comfortable. </p>
